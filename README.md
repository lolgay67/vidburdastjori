Virknin er komin vel áleiðis og lookið betra en það var.
This is a Calendar app that lets you create events and shows when they are. It is capable of saving events to the disk but for unknown reasons loading them from the disk does not seem to work and break the program just a lil bit.

To run the program you need to excecute mvn javafx:run
Most of the maven functions work but due to this being a javafx program i would recommend using the above command.
For testing we included surefire so to test the application the command is "mvn surefire:test"
